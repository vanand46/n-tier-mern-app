# N-Tier MERN App

**N-Tier Architecture** is a design pattern where the components of an application are separated into different layers or tiers, each with its own specific responsibilities. Typically, it includes:

- **Presentation Tier**: The user interface or client that interacts with users.
- **Application Tier**: The business logic, APIs, and core application functionality.
- **Data Tier**: The database or storage system.

In **MERN** stack (**MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, Node.js**), the application is divided into distinct layers:

1. **Frontend (Presentation Tier)**: React.js is used for building the user interface
2. **Backend (Application Tier)**: Express.js (running on Node.js) handles API requests and serves data to the frontend.
3. **Database (Data Tier)**: MongoDB stores the application's data.
